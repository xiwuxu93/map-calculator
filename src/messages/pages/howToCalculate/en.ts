  t0015: 'Mean Arterial Pressure calculation is a core competency across nearly every clinical discipline. Whether you are a student preparing for board exams, a new graduate learning ICU workflows, or a seasoned clinician guiding complex cases, you will calculate MAP repeatedly throughout your career.',

  t0023: 'Emergency department:',
  t0024: '"This trauma patient\'s MAP is only 58."',
  t0025: 'Why Not Just Use Blood Pressure?',
  t0026: 'Blood pressure provides two discrete numbers (systolic and diastolic) that describe arterial pressure at the peaks and troughs of the cardiac cycle. Organs, however, experience continuous perfusion. MAP represents the average perfusion pressure across the entire cycle, making it the preferred threshold in critical care protocols.',
  t0027: 'Critical Point',
  t0028: 'Many emergency, critical care, and operative pathways specify MAP targets rather than systolic blood pressure goals. If you cannot calculate MAP quickly and accurately, you cannot implement these protocols effectively.',
  t0029: 'Understanding the MAP Formula',
  t0030: 'The standard formula is simple to remember but rooted in cardiac physiology:',
  t0031: 'MAP = (Systolic BP + 2 × Diastolic BP) ÷ 3',
  t0032: 'Because the heart spends approximately one-third of the cardiac cycle in systole and two-thirds in diastole, the equation doubles the diastolic value before averaging. This weighting mirrors how long the arterial tree experiences each pressure.',
  t0033: 'Simple Average vs. Weighted Formula',
  t0034: 'Consider blood pressure 120/80:',
  t0035: 'Simple average (incorrect): (120 + 80) ÷ 2 = 100 mmHg',
  t0036: 'Weighted formula (correct): (120 + 160) ÷ 3 = 93 mmHg',
  t0037: 'In hypotensive patients, this difference can determine whether you escalate treatment.',
  t0038: 'Alternative Pulse Pressure Formula',
  t0039: 'Many clinicians prefer this mental math version:',
  t0040: 'MAP = Diastolic BP + (Pulse Pressure ÷ 3)',
  t0041: 'Pulse pressure is simply systolic minus diastolic. Divide by three and add to the diastolic value to reach the same result as the standard equation.',
  t0042: 'When the Formula Needs Confirmation',
  t0043: 'The standard calculation assumes normal heart rate, regular rhythm, and typical systolic/diastolic timing. In extreme tachycardia, severe bradycardia, or conditions like aortic regurgitation, diastolic time may be dramatically altered. Invasive monitoring is preferred for these patients.',

  t0164: 'The heart spends more time in diastole than systole, so the average arterial pressure is closer to the diastolic value. A simple average ignores this physiologic timing and overestimates perfusion.',
  t0165: 'Is MAP calculation the same for arterial lines and cuffs?',
  t0166: 'Yes, although arterial line monitors perform the calculation automatically. Cuff-derived values require manual calculation but are typically accurate within 5-10 mmHg under stable conditions.',
  t0167: 'How often should I calculate MAP?',
  t0168: 'Frequency depends on acuity: every 15-30 minutes during active resuscitation, every 1-4 hours in the ICU, and with routine vitals on the floor. In clinic settings, calculate when perfusion decisions matter.',
  t0169: 'Do all patients need MAP calculations?',
  t0170: 'No. Prioritize MAP for shock, sepsis, neuro critical care, high-risk post-operative patients, and anyone on vasoactive support. For routine hypertension management, systolic/diastolic values suffice.',
  t0171: 'Can MAP replace blood pressure for hypertension diagnosis?',
  t0172: 'Hypertension guidelines still rely on systolic/diastolic thresholds (≥130/80 mmHg). MAP supplements rather than replaces those measures, especially in acute care.',
