  {
    question: "What's the fastest way to estimate MAP from BP?",
    answer:
      "Use the mental math shortcut: MAP ≈ DBP + (pulse pressure ÷ 3). For 120/80, pulse pressure is 40. Divide by 3 (≈13) and add to the diastolic value (80 + 13 = 93 mmHg).",
  },
  {
    question: "Is MAP more important than blood pressure?",
    answer:
      "They answer different clinical questions. MAP reflects organ perfusion pressure, whereas systolic/diastolic values guide hypertension diagnosis and cardiac workload assessment. In critical care, MAP is often the priority metric.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use automated BP monitors for MAP calculation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most oscillometric monitors are accurate and some display MAP automatically. If yours does not, enter the systolic and diastolic values into this calculator to obtain MAP and interpretation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use MAP or systolic BP for sepsis management?",
    answer:
      "Follow MAP. Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines target MAP ≥65 mmHg because it correlates better with organ perfusion than systolic pressure alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my patient's MAP calculation seems inaccurate?",
    answer:
      "Confirm accurate BP measurement, verify the numbers were entered correctly, and repeat manually if the result does not match the patient's presentation. Consider arterial line placement if discrepancies persist.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do MAP targets vary by patient population?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Elderly patients with chronic hypertension may need MAP 70-85 mmHg, young adults may tolerate 60-65 mmHg, traumatic brain injury often requires 80-110 mmHg, and stroke protocols may set permissive hypertension goals.",

        "The heart spends roughly one-third of each cardiac cycle in systole (contraction) and two-thirds in diastole (relaxation). Because diastole lasts longer, diastolic pressure weighs more heavily in the mean arterial calculation. The formula reflects this physiological ratio.",
